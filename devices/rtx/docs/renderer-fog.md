# VISRTX_RENDERER_FOG: camera-surface depth cueing

`VISRTX_RENDERER_FOG` is a **VisRTX vendor extension**, advertised as
`ANARI_VISRTX_RENDERER_FOG`. It is RTX-only, not a KHR extension, and introduces
no new ANARI object. Set its parameters on an existing Renderer.

## Support and discovery

Supported Renderer subtypes are `fast`, `interactive`, `default` (an alias for
`interactive`), and `quality`. Diagnostic `debug` (including its `debug_*`
factory aliases) and `test` Renderers do not support or advertise fog.

Query `anariGetObjectInfo(device, ANARI_DEVICE, nullptr, "extension",
ANARI_STRING_LIST)` for device availability, then query the same information
with `ANARI_RENDERER` and the intended subtype for subtype support. The device's
`extension` property also reports availability. A device-wide capability is
not a promise about every Renderer.

The VisRTX utility provides the same fog check:

```cpp
#include <anari/ext/visrtx/visrtx_extensions.h>

const auto features =
    visrtx::getObjectExtensions(device, ANARI_RENDERER, "quality");
if (features.VISRTX_RENDERER_FOG) {
  // Configure fog on a quality Renderer.
}
```

The generated `parameter` object-info list contains exactly the seven fog
parameters below on each supported subtype. `anariGetParameterInfo()` exposes
`default`, `description`, `required`, numeric `minimum`, selector `value`
(`ANARI_STRING_LIST`), and `sourceExtension` (`VISRTX_RENDERER_FOG`). Units,
finite-value constraints, and conditional applicability are in the descriptions;
there is no separate query for relational constraints such as end > start.
This contract uses subtype queries, not a new Renderer-instance property.

## Parameters

All parameters are optional. Defaults are restored when a parameter is unset
and the Renderer is committed.

| Parameter | ANARI type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fogMode` | `ANARI_STRING` | `"none"` | `none`, `linear`, `exp`, `exp2`; `none` is the only disable switch |
| `fogDistanceMetric` | `ANARI_STRING` | `"viewDepth"` | `viewDepth` or `rayDistance`, in world units |
| `fogColorSource` | `ANARI_STRING` | `"constant"` | `constant` or `background` |
| `fogColor` | `ANARI_FLOAT32_VEC3` | `(1,1,1)` | Finite nonnegative **linear RGB**, including HDR values above one; used only with `constant` |
| `fogStart` | `ANARI_FLOAT32` | `0` | Finite nonnegative world distance; used only by `linear` |
| `fogEnd` | `ANARI_FLOAT32` | `1` | Finite world distance strictly greater than start; used only by `linear` |
| `fogDensity` | `ANARI_FLOAT32` | `1` | Finite nonnegative inverse-world-distance curve coefficient; used only by `exp` and `exp2` |

For surface RGB `S`, selected fog RGB `B`, distance `d`, visibility `T`, and fog
fraction `F = 1-T`, the camera appearance is `T*S + F*B`:

| Mode | Visibility / fraction |
|---|---|
| `none` | `T = 1`, `F = 0` |
| `linear` | `F = clamp((d-start)/(end-start), 0, 1)` |
| `exp` | `T = exp(-density*d)` |
| `exp2` | `T = exp(-(density*d)^2)` |

Zero density or zero distance yields no fog. Very large optical arguments may
saturate to full fog. A short valid linear interval is not replaced with an
arbitrary world-unit epsilon. Density in `exp2` is an artistic curve
coefficient, not a physical homogeneous extinction coefficient.

### Camera metrics

Let `P` be the world-space surface point, `C` the committed camera position,
`V` its normalized forward direction, and `O` the **original camera-sample ray
origin**:

- `viewDepth`: `max(0, dot(P-C, V))`. Ray-buffer cameras still use their committed
  reference position/direction, not each supplied ray's direction.
- `rayDistance`: `length(P-O)`. `O` is the pinhole position, per-pixel
  orthographic origin, sampled lens origin for depth of field, or supplied
  ray-buffer origin. An orthographic plane does not acquire radial edge fog.

Clipping intervals, cutting planes, coverage pass-through, and numerical ray
re-origining do not change `O`. Distances are not normalized device depth and do
not depend on a far plane. Translating camera and scene together preserves fog;
scaling both by a positive factor preserves it when start/end scale likewise or
exponential density is divided by that factor.

## Examples

Using the ANARI C++ helpers, with an already created supported `renderer`:

```cpp
// Constant-color linear depth cueing from 10 to 100 world units.
const float blueGray[] = {0.25f, 0.35f, 0.5f};
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogMode", "linear");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogDistanceMetric", "viewDepth");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogColorSource", "constant");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogColor", ANARI_FLOAT32_VEC3, blueGray);
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogStart", 10.f);
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogEnd", 100.f);
anari::commitParameters(device, renderer);

// Fade toward the visible backdrop, using radial camera-sample distance.
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogMode", "exp");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogDistanceMetric", "rayDistance");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogColorSource", "background");
anari::setParameter(device, renderer, "fogDensity", 0.01f); // inverse world units
anari::commitParameters(device, renderer);
// The earlier start/end and fogColor have no effect in this configuration.

anari::unsetParameter(device, renderer, "fogMode"); // restore "none"
anari::commitParameters(device, renderer);
```

### Visible background and linear color

`background` selects the existing **unfogged visible backdrop**, not an arbitrary
illuminating light. It respects visible HDRI selection/addition, light tint and
radiance scale, instance transforms, and existing precedence over screen
backgrounds. Invisible HDRIs can illuminate surfaces without becoming fog color.
Flat/image backgrounds use the same frame-resolution screen coordinates as the
ordinary compositor, including image-region behavior. Directional environment
lookup uses the original camera-sample direction, never a reflection direction.
No new background form is introduced.

Fog reuses the effective linear RGB under `premultiplyBackground`; it does not
reinterpret background alpha or guess an external compositor's backdrop.
`fogColor` is entirely ignored in background mode, not used as a tint. The
operation happens before sample filtering, accumulation, output encoding, and
display transforms. For numerical comparisons disable denoising and nonlinear
firefly filtering; those existing image operations can change the final output.

## Coverage, transport, and channels

For coverage `alpha` and premultiplied RGB `Pm`, the deposited contribution is
`T*Pm + alpha*F*B`. **Alpha does not change.** Each directly visible layer uses
its own distance, before existing compositing/coverage decisions. Discarded or
zero-coverage contributions inject no fog color. Silhouette/depth-edge samples
are fogged individually, not by a postprocess over resolved color/depth.

Fast/interactive retain their straight-through coverage and colored material
transmission weights. Quality retains its stochastic coverage continuation:
finite-sample images need not equal deterministic layer compositing exactly.
The accepted camera surface's complete shaded result, including indirect
reflection/refraction, is depth-cued once. Secondary transport does not acquire
additional fog events, and appearance weights do not change BSDFs, emission
used for lighting, light sampling/PDFs, shadows, random decisions, or Russian
roulette. Full fog does not terminate geometric traversal or skip metadata.

Already-visible analytic Light Proxies receive the opaque surface transform at
their hit distance. Fast still excludes these proxies. Visibility, unpickable
IDs, and subtype-specific depth behavior stay unchanged; lights are not
converted to Materials.

Scientific volumes are not fog. Direct volume RGB is unchanged, while directly
visible surfaces behind volume attenuation use their own surface distances and
existing visibility weights. After a volume scattering event, later surfaces
and lights are indirect transport, not new camera-fog events. Indirect volume
radiance belongs to the already depth-cued camera surface's shading. This is an
artistic surface-only effect, not atmospheric transport through a combined medium.

Misses keep their existing backdrop color and alpha, even with full fog. Depth,
primitive/object/instance IDs, normals, and albedo retain their existing meanings
and sampling rules. The independent Renderer Pipelines, callable Material Shader
interfaces, Light Proxy representation, and separate surface/volume TLASes are
unchanged. Fog needs no new callable slot or acceleration-structure rebuild.

## Commit and invalid inputs

Parameter edits take effect at Commit through the normal Frontend lifecycle.
Unsetting any parameter restores its default, never a stale prior value.
Effective fog changes invalidate accumulated color; changes to an observed
background image/HDRI or background setting also invalidate dependent color.
Use the normal ANARI array map/unmap or object commit lifecycle for such edits.
Renderers may share a World without sharing fog state.

`none` bypasses validation of inactive selectors/numbers. Active modes validate
mode, metric, source, and only the numbers needed by those selections. Unknown
selectors, wrong active types, non-finite active numbers, negative active
color/start/density, or end <= start produce a warning naming the invalid fog
setting and disable the **entire effective fog operation for that commit**.
They are not silently clamped or replaced by the previous effect. Unrelated
Renderer/World settings remain intact; a corrected Commit recovers normally.

## Compatibility and verification

GL-style exponential start/end are ignored: density 0.1 at distance 10 gives
visibility approximately 0.367879 even when start is 5, not 0.606531. Converting
normalized D3D device-depth endpoints to view distances alone does not reproduce
an arbitrary depth-buffer fog curve. This is not a promise of pixel-identical
images across Renderer subtypes or historical engines.

Height fog, participating media/volumetric fog, new ANARI objects, fogged skies,
shadow/secondary-segment fog, and VisGL support are outside this contract. No
KHR, height-fog, or volumetric-fog capability is advertised.

The public-ANARI release tests and tolerances are indexed in
[renderer-fog-conformance.md](renderer-fog-conformance.md). The verified baseline
uses native materials and structuredRegular volumes, an RTX 5880 Ada GPU,
CUDA 13.2, OptiX 9.0, and a Release RTX-only build with MDL/MaterialX disabled.
This is not evidence for untested material configurations, other GPUs, or GL.
