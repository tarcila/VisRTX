# RTX fog release conformance

The public interface under test is ANARI: capability/parameter queries, object
creation and Commit, render/wait, mapped channels, and status callbacks. Tests
live in [`../apps/tests/api/`](../apps/tests/api/) and are individually registered
with CTest. All six image executables require discovery on all four supported
names; absence is a failure, not a reason to skip rendering.

In the table, **all** means `fast`, `interactive`, `default`, and `quality`.
Quality's stochastic coverage/volume cases use their own references, not a
straight-through Renderer as ground truth. Function names and quoted case labels
identify executable cases; no private fog evaluator supplies expected values.

## Tolerances and non-vacuous controls

- Deterministic linear float RGB: `abs(error) <= 1e-5 + 1e-4*abs(reference)`.
  Exact paired equality is used for unchanged channels/disabled output. Encoded
  sRGB comparisons independently encode linear RGB and allow one code value.
- Quality HDR attenuation: one paired sample avoids overflowing the unfogged
  accumulation sum. Direct emission and reflection exercise `exp`/`exp2`
  visibility below the FLOAT32 normal range against long-double affine
  references, with the deterministic RGB tolerance and exact auxiliary checks.
- AO-only control: fast/interactive/default use 64 spp × 16 AO samples, no
  direct irradiance, and radii .25/20. The rear receiver must recover .12
  unoccluded radiance at the short radius and darken by more than .02 at the
  long radius; a paired linear-fog render must preserve that AO contribution.
- Lens: 4096 spp over 16 pixels (65536 samples), aperture radius 8 and focal
  distance 10. The independent radial density is `2*d/64` on
  `[10,sqrt(164)]`; limits are .007 per pixel and .002 image mean. These are
  conservative six-standard-error criteria, not an IID claim for Halton samples.
- Quality layers: 4096 spp, .05 per-pixel RGBA and .008 mean error in each of six
  disjoint origin/half-image groups (at least 40 pixels/group). Zero-opacity
  and cutout cases are included. Edge references use paired 256-spp sampling
  and retain the deterministic combined tolerance.
- Quality transport: 4096 spp; opaque once-only affine comparisons retain the
  deterministic tolerance. Partial front coverage allows .05 pixel / .009
  per-origin-group error. Controlled emitter/tint means and a max-depth-one
  control establish actual secondary radiance. The four-interface RR mean has
  a .025 bound; fog may not alter paired transport/AOVs.
- Straight-through jittered slabs: 16384 samples, transmission allowance
  .000329618705 from independently bounded quadrature bias plus Hoeffding error
  (failure probability 1e-9), scaled by color contrast plus numeric tolerance.
  Integral-step slabs and the oblique cross-product are deterministic.
- Quality camera survival/coverage: 4096 spp, two groups of 120 pixels;
  Hoeffding bounds .0511303 per pixel / .00466754 per group for unit-range
  observations (two-sided failure probability 1e-9 per assertion), plus numeric
  tolerance. Paired scattering-volume lighting cancels in the surface-difference
  oracle. Volume-only RGB and all auxiliary channels remain paired-identical.

The release cross-product explicitly runs background-source layers and layered
state transitions on all four names. Fast/interactive/default additionally run
120 interaction cases each: two metrics × two sources × five modes
(none/linear/exp/exp2/full) × three contribution types (backdrop/surface/proxy) ×
volume present/absent. Fast's absent proxy is an expected unchanged backdrop,
not a skipped case. Quality's corresponding absorbing/scattering/coverage
matrix and indirect volume/proxy references are separate cases above. All
background forms and background lifecycle cases run under both metrics.

## Reproduce the baseline

Configure a fresh build (reuse it for subsequent runs):

```sh
cmake -S . -B _out/fog -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DVISRTX_BUILD_GL_DEVICE=OFF -DVISRTX_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DOPTIX_FETCH_VERSION=9.0 -DVISRTX_MIN_ARCH=89 \
  -DVISRTX_ENABLE_MDL_SUPPORT=OFF -DVISRTX_ENABLE_MATERIALX_SUPPORT=OFF \
  -DVISRTX_LIBRARY_NAME=visrtx_fog
cmake --build _out/fog --parallel 4
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/_out/fog:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" \
  ctest --test-dir _out/fog -C Release --output-on-failure
```

A focused run uses `-R '^TestRendererFog'`; add `-V` to see the quantitative
measurements. Prepending the build's library directory is important if another
VisRTX is installed. Check `ldd _out/fog/TestRendererFogDiscovery` under the same
environment before interpreting a run as release evidence.

### Recorded release baseline (2026-10-08)

**All 22 rows passed** in the native-material RTX-only configuration on NVIDIA
RTX 5880 Ada Generation, driver 615.71.09, CUDA 13.2.51, OptiX 9.0.
The final full run passed **47/47 CTests, no skipped test or promised Renderer
subtype**, in 194.73 seconds. This includes all seven fog executables and the
existing disabled-mode regressions. MDL/MaterialX configurations, other GPUs,
and other backends were not tested or claimed by this baseline.

Representative measurements from that run:

- New straight-through interaction matrix: maximum absolute error
  `3.72529e-7` on each of fast/interactive/default (120 cases each).
- Omitted/none/inactive-invalid layered channels: zero mismatches on all four
  names at paired 64 spp. Layered recommits matched fresh Renderers after four
  old accumulation frames (1 spp straight-through, 4096 spp Quality).
- Lens means, all names: linear `.57304336` vs `.57303372`; exp `.43573207` vs
  `.43572680`; exp2 `.28031677` vs `.28030917`.
- Quality absorbing-volume surface/proxy maximum group errors `.000326090` /
  `.000265055`; scattering-volume surface/proxy `.00108180` / `.000442176`.
  Indirect volume paired maximum RGB error `.0000337958`.
- Controlled indirect reflection/refraction mean red `.960205` / `.959974`
  versus `.96`, unchanged when the emitter moves. The refracted-volume
  fixture's indirect red `.0640569` proves live secondary volume radiance.
- Existing visible-light regression: floor/proxy oracle relative error
  `.001273`, reflected-light oracle `.001732`, occlusion parity `.000432`.
  Existing alpha, ray-buffer, frame-channel, and recommit checks passed.

Discovery was red before publication (missing capability and metadata), then
green after schema generation. Utility discovery independently failed six
support checks before wiring the new field. A temporary mutation making
background-source `rayDistance` use view depth failed the interaction and
coverage suites, including the newly combined cases; it was removed before
the final build. No production evaluator, integrator, transport, or tolerance
change was needed to close this release verification ticket.
